	* [The Tale of a Fameless but Widespread Web Vulnerability Class - Veit Hailperin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qA0CtS6cZ4)
		* Two keys components account for finding vulnerabilities of a certain class: awareness of the vulnerability and ease of finding the vulnerability. Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerabilities are not mentioned in the de facto standard for public attention - the OWASP Top 10. Additionally there is no public tool available to facilitate finding XSSI. The impact reaches from leaking personal information stored, circumvention of token-based protection to complete compromise of accounts. XSSI vulnerabilities are fairly wide spread and the lack of detection increases the risk of each XSSI. In this talk we are going to demonstrate how to find XSSI, exploit XSSI and also how to protect against XSSI.

		* This page is a rough collection of notes on some of the fundamental alternatives to direct script injection that would be available to attackers following the universal deployment of CSP or other security mechanisms designed to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts. I hope to demonstrate that in many cases, the capabilities offered by these alternative methods are highly compatible with the goals of contemporary XSS attacks.

		* Most web applications used for complex business operations and/or employing advanced GUI frameworks have stateful functionality. Certain workflows, for example, might require completing certain steps before a transaction is committed, or a request sent by a client-side UI element might need several preceding requests that all contribute to the session state. Most automated tools focus on a request and maybe a redirection, thus completely missing the point in these cases, where resending a request gets ignored by the target application. As a result, while these tools are getting better day by day, using them for testing such execution paths are usually out of the question. Since thorough assessment is cumbersome without such tools, there's progress, but we are far from plug-and-play products. This paper focuses on the capabilities of currently available solutions, demonstrating their pros and cons, along with opportunities for improvement.
	* [SSL/TLS Interception Proxies and Transitive Trust](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-12/Jarmoc/bh-eu-12-Jarmoc-SSL_TLS_Interception-WP.pdf)
		* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS), have become key components of the modern Internet. The privacy, integrity, and authenticity provided by these protocols are critical to allowing sensitive communications to occur. Without these systems, e-commerce, online banking, and business-to-business exchange of information would likely be far less frequent. Threat actors have also recognized the benefits of transport security, and they are increasingly turning to SSL to hide their activities. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT ) attackers, botnets, and eve n commodity web attacks can leverage SSL encryption to evade detection. To counter these tactics, organizations are increasingly deploying security controls that intercept end-to-end encrypted channels. Web proxies, data loss prevention (DLP) systems, specialized threat detection solutions, and network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) offer functionality to intercept, inspect, and filter encrypted traffic. Similar functionality is present in lawful intercept systems and solutions enabling the broad surveillance of encrypted communications by governments. Broadly classified as “SSL/TLS interception proxies”, these solutions act as a “man-in-the-middle", violating the end-to-end security promises of SSL. This type of interception comes at a cost. Intercepting SSL-encrypted connections sacrifices a degree of privacy and integrity for the benefit of content inspection, often at the risk of authenticity and endpoint validation. Implementers and designers of SSL interception proxies should consider these risks and understand how their systems operate in unusual circumstances

	* [Self-Exfiltration: The Dangers of Browser-Enforced Information Flow Control](http://ericchen.me/self_exfiltration.pdf)
		* Abstract —Since the early days of Netscape, browser vendors and web security researchers have restricted out-going data based on its destination. The security argument accompanying these mechanisms is that they prevent sensitive user data from being sent to the attacker’s domain. However, in this paper, we show that regulating web information flow based on its destination server is an inherently flawed security practice. It is vulnerable to self-exfiltration attacks, where an adversary stashes stolen information in the database of a whitelisted site, then later independently connects to the whitelisted site to retrieve the information. We describe eight existing browser security mechanisms that are vulnerable to these “self-exfiltration” attacks. Furthermore, we discovered at least one exfiltration channel for each of the Alexa top 100 websites. None of the existing information flow control mechanisms we surveyed are sufficient to protect data from being leaked to the attacker. Our goal is to prevent browser vendors and researchers from falling into this trap by designing more systems that are vulnerable to self-exfiltration.

		* Existing web scanners search for server-side injection vulnerabilities by throwing a canned list of technology-specific payloads at a target and looking for signatures - almost like an anti-virus. In this document, I'll share the conception and development of an alternative approach, capable of finding and confirming both known and unknown classes of injection vulnerabilities. Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps many of the benefits of manual testing including casual WAF evasion, a tiny network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.

		* RPO (Relative Path Overwrite) is a technique to take advantage of relative URLs by overwriting their target file. To understand the technique we must first look into the differences between relative and absolute URLs. An absolute URL is basically the full URL for a destination address including the protocol and domain name whereas a relative URL doesn’t specify a domain or protocol and uses the existing destination to determine the protocol and domain.

		* Due to their high practical impact, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks have attracted a lot of attention from the security community members. In the same way, a plethora of more or less effective defense techniques have been proposed, addressing the causes and effects of XSS vulnerabilities. As a result, an adversary often can no longer inject or even execute arbitrary scripting code in several real-life scenarios. In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remains after XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mitigated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScript code. We address the question of whether an attacker really needs JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacks aiming for information theft. The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML, inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive informati on from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrar y data displayed on a given website. We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mitigation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition, we have implemented a browser patch that enables a website to make a vital determination as to being loaded in a detached view or pop-up window. This approach proves useful for prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

	* [The Spy in the Sandbox – Practical Cache Attacks in Javascript](http://iss.oy.ne.ro/SpyInTheSandbox.pdf)
		* We present the first micro-architectural side-channel attack which runs entirely in the browser. In contrast to other works in this genre, this attack does not require the attacker to install any software on the victim’s machine to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an untrusted webpage with attacker-controlled content. This makes the attack model highly scalable and extremely relevant and practical to today’s web, especially since most desktop browsers currently accessing the In- ternet are vulnerable to this attack. Our attack, which is an extension of the last-level cache attacks of Yarom et al., allows a remote adversary recover information belonging to other processes, other users and even other virtual machines running on the same physical host as the victim web browser. We describe the fundamentals behind our attack, evaluate its performance using a high bandwidth covert channel and finally use it to construct a system-wide mouse/network activity logger. Defending against this attack is possible, but the required counter- measures can exact an impractical cost on other benign uses of the web browser and of the computer.

The motivation behind this tool is to provide an easy and robust way to scrutinize the security configurations of sharepoint and frontpage based web applications. Due to the complex nature of these web administration software, it is required to have a simple and efficient tool that gathers information, check access permissions, dump critical information from default files and perform automated exploitation if security risks are identified. A number of automated scanners fall short of this and Sparty is a solution to that.

It's already widely understood that certain CORS configurations are dangerous. In this presentation, I'll skim over the old knowledge then coax out and share with you an array of under-appreciated but dangerous subtleties and implications buried in the CORS specification. I'll illustrate each of these with recent attacks on real websites, showing how I could have used them to steal bitcoins from two different exchanges, partially bypass Google's use of HTTPS, and requisition API keys from numerous others. I'll also show how CORS blunders can provide an invaluable link in crafting exploit chains to pivot across protocols, exploit the unexploitable via server and client-side cache poisoning, and even escalate certain open redirects into vulnerabilities that are actually notable.

			* We provide a number of practical techniques and algorithms for exploiting randomness vulnerabilities in PHP applications.We focus on the predictability of password reset tokens and demonstrate how an attacker can take over user accounts in a web application via predicting or algorithmically derandomizing the PHP core randomness generators. While our techniques are designed for the PHP language, the principles behind our techniques and our algorithms are independent of PHP and can readily apply to any system that utilizes weak randomness generators or low entropy sources. Our results include: algorithms that reduce the entropy of time variables, identifying and exploiting vulnera- bilities of the PHP system that enable the recovery or reconstruction of PRNG seeds, an experimental analysis of the Hastad-Shamir framework for breaking truncated linear variables, an optimized online Gaussian solver for large sparse linear systems, and an algorithm for recovering the state of the Mersenne twister generator from any level of truncation.  We demonstrate the gravity of our attacks via a number of case studies. Specifically, we show that a number of current widely used web applications can be broken using our tech- niques including Mediawiki, Joomla, Gallery, osCommerce and others.

We analyze how PHP object injection (POI) vulnerabilities can be exploited via property-oriented programming (POP) and perform a systematic analysis of available gadgets in common PHP applications. Furthermore, we introduce an automated approach to statically detect POI vulnerabilities in object-oriented PHP code. Our approach is also capable of generating POP chains in an automated way. We implemented a prototype of the proposed approach and evaluated it with 10 well-known applications. Overall, we detected 30 new POI vulnerabilities and 28 new gadget chains

		* REST, or Representational State Transfer, just refers to the protocol with which the whole Web works. No big. We are used to using REST with a browser, but there is more to it - we can write programs with REST. The problem is that writing properties and functions using the web's transfer protocol open them up to all of the security weaknesses of the web, and we know there are a few of those. Finding those bugs is just half of the battle - fixing them is a whole other story. You'll need the details, and you'll get them here.

Astra can be used by security engineers or developers as an integral part of their process, so they can detect and patch vulnerabilities early during development cycle. Astra can automatically detect and test login & logout (Authentication API), so it's easy for anyone to integrate this into CICD pipeline. Astra can take API collection as an input so this can also be used for testing apis in standalone mode.

		* As a part of an ongoing investigation on Adobe Flash SOP bypass techniques, we identified a vulnerability affecting old releases of the Adobe Flex SDK compiler. Further investigation traced the issue back to a well known vulnerability (CVE20112461), already patched by Adobe. Old vulnerability, let's move on? Not this time. CVE20112461 is a very interesting bug. As long as the SWF file was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK, attackers can still use this vulnerability against the latest web browsers and Flash plugin. Even with the most recent updates, vulnerable Flex applications hosted on your domain can be exploited. In this presentation, we will disclose the details of this vulnerability (Adobe has never released all technicalities) and we will discuss how we conducted a large scale analysis on popular websites, resulting in the identification of numerous Alexa Top 50 sites vulnerable to this bug. Finally, we will also release a custom tool and a Burp plugin capable of detecting vulnerable SWF applications.

		* More and more businesses are moving away from monolithic servers and turning to event-driven microservices powered by cloud function providers like AWS Lambda. So, how do we hack in to a server that only exists for 60 milliseconds? This talk will show novel attack vectors using cloud event sources, exploitabilities in common server-less patterns and frameworks, abuse of undocumented features in AWS Lambda for persistent malware injection, identifying valuable targets for pilfering, and, of course, how to exfiltrate juicy data out of a secure Virtual Private Cloud.

The talk will follow a knowledgeable intruder from the first second after identifying a vulnerability in a cloud-deployed Web application and all the steps he takes to reach the root account for the Amazon user. Except for the initial vulnerability, a classic remote file included in a Web application which grants access to the front-end EC2 instance, all the other vulnerabilities and weaknesses exploited by this intruder are going to be cloud-specific.

		* buckethead.py searches across every AWS region for a variety of bucket names based on a domain name, subdomains, affixes given and more. Currently the tool will only present to you whether or not the bucket exists or if they're listable. If the bucket is listable, then further interrogation of the resource can be done. It does not attempt download or upload permissions currently but could be added as a module in the future. You will need the awscli to run this tool as this is a python wrapper around this tool.
